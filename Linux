Linux is an opensource Platform
Main components of Linux
  1. Kernal  also called OS
  2. shell
  3. Hardware
  4. Applications
Kernal is the heart of the OS, the kernel interacts with the hardware
shell takes the inputs from the user and passes them to the kernel
OS-> os is a bridge between the user and the hardware
UNIX: is not portable and costly need to buy both OS and hardware  so it's costly, and tightly coupled with hardware
Kernel + Linux = Linux, Inventor Linus Torvals
Linux is free and open-source software, it's portable and has no hardware locking 
96% of servers are running in the world on Linux, even supercomputers also.
why Linux is good than any OS :
  #. less cost & More performance and secured 
  #. consume less memory and more speed
  #. secured - originally from unix Principles
  #. More community support and & Very stable (Linux can run without restarting  and without doing any updates run  for years)
  #. Consume low Power
Linux OS or Kernel.?
Linux is a kernel and opensource code kernel with a shell

added more utilities such as Ubuntu, Centos, Fedora, Redhat and etc

Linux + Shell+ graphics = Android, Ubuntu, Desktop
Linux + Shell + some Utilities = Server
